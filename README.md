# Hello There!
My name is Sepehr Borji, and I'm an Engineering Student who loves to make games in his spare time!

# Project Highlights

## Lazy Gun Run | Unity and C#

You can find this game on the Google play store and on my Itch.io under the developer name "Dr. Apple". What's special about this game is that all art and animations were custom made, which forced me to learn animation, importing and creating of assets, as well as implementing mechanics I've never tried before, such as jumping, shooting, and adding effects to improve the experience of the game.

## Breakthru | Unity and C#

Since the assets were incredibly simple to make, the focus here was making my first project without any tutorials. I implemented 2D physics and very basic player movement. This game was simply to dip my toes into creating a project from conception to completion successfully, and the next projects will be more ambitious.

## Memory Systems Tool | Python

This project was not born out of simply wanting to make a project, but because I needed a tool to help me work on my memorization skills, and ironically, a method for this was to use a memory system that I was reading about at the time. With this program I automated a "flash-card" like process to help me remember and in doing so, improve my memory even further. Without this tool it probably would've taken me an hour just to practice system once, but this tool allowed the process to condense down to 10 minutes per practice.
